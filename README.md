This repository is for exercises in Part 9 of Full Stack Open (FSO), "TypeScript" - https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9

The exercises in this part use TypeScript in backend Express apps, in frontend React apps, and in full-stack web apps combining Express and React.

There are four projects contained in this repository:

* /ts_BMI_Exercise - a typed express app that returns BMI data or exercise plan summaries
* /course_parts - a typed React web app that displays a summary of a web development course
* /flight_diaries_frontend - a typed React web app that displays and allows input of flight diaries; interfaces with a backend developed in the course material
* /patientor_frontend and /patientor_backend - a typed full-stack web app with medical care visits for patients
